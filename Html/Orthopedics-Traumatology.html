            <h1>Services we offer:</h1>
            <h2>Nonsurgical treatment:</h2>
            <p>Several musculoskeletal conditions can be well-treated without the need for surgery. Our orthopedics evaluate the issues and prescribe a tailored treatment involving medication, exercise, rehabilitation or alternative therapies in favor of the patient’s health conditions. In cases, where non-surgical treatments don’t bring out the best results, going for surgical options is considered a good option.</p>
            <p>We provide non-surgical treatment for common to severe orthopedic conditions like:</p>
            <h2>Back Pain:</h2>
            <p>One of the initial treatments for chronic back pain is exercise, which is planned under the guidance of a physician and spine physical therapist. A back brace is provided to patients who find it comfortable and effectively reduces their pain. Chronic back pain can be alleviated by various nonsurgical treatments, including acupuncture, massage, biofeedback therapy, laser therapy, and electrical nerve stimulation.</p>
            <h2>Slip Disc: </h2>
            <p>One should certainly avoid all types of strenuous sports and work activities. It is believed that inflammation in the nerves and soft tissue surrounding a herniated disc is responsible for some of the associated pain. However, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications can be used to treat the inflammation effectively, which can help reduce swelling and alleviate the resulting pain.</p>
            <p>Other conditions that can be managed through non-surgical means: </p>
            <li>Osteoporosis</li>
            <li>Arthritis</li>
            <li>Fractures</li>
            <li>Torn Ligaments</li>
            <li>Sprains and strains</li>
            <li>Sports Injuries</li>
